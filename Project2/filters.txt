üñºÔ∏è IMAGE FILTERS OVERVIEW
===========================

This document explains the purpose and common use cases of each image filter
implemented in the project. These filters enhance, stylize, or analyze images
for different creative and technical applications.

------------------------------------------------------
1Ô∏è‚É£  DISCRETE COSINE TRANSFORM (discrete_cosine.py)
------------------------------------------------------
The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) filter is widely used for image compression
and frequency analysis. It converts spatial image data into frequency components,
making it easier to identify dominant visual patterns and remove less important data.

üß† Use Cases:
- Image compression (e.g., JPEG)
- Frequency domain filtering
- Noise reduction by removing high-frequency components
- Texture analysis

------------------------------------------------------
2Ô∏è‚É£  EMBOSS FILTER (emboss_filter.py)
------------------------------------------------------
The emboss filter gives the image a 3D relief effect by highlighting edges and
simulating light falling on the surface. It makes the image appear as if it‚Äôs
engraved or raised from the background.

üé® Use Cases:
- Stylized 3D artistic effects
- Texture enhancement for objects
- Edge highlighting with depth perception

------------------------------------------------------
3Ô∏è‚É£  FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM - HIGH PASS FILTER (fftHPF.py)
------------------------------------------------------
The FFT High-Pass Filter removes low-frequency components (smooth areas) and
preserves high-frequency details (edges and fine structures). The result is a
sharper, more detailed image emphasizing transitions and boundaries.

üî¨ Use Cases:
- Sharpening and edge detection
- Highlighting fine details
- Frequency-based image analysis
- Enhancing textures in microscopy or satellite images

------------------------------------------------------
4Ô∏è‚É£  FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM - LOW PASS FILTER (fftLPF.py)
------------------------------------------------------
The FFT Low-Pass Filter smooths images by eliminating high-frequency noise and
retaining low-frequency components. This produces a blurred effect that reduces
details and softens textures.

üå´Ô∏è Use Cases:
- Image denoising
- Background smoothing
- Preprocessing before edge detection
- Reducing artifacts in scanned or compressed images

------------------------------------------------------
5Ô∏è‚É£  GABOR FILTER (gabor.py)
------------------------------------------------------
Gabor filters are powerful tools for texture analysis and feature extraction.
They respond strongly to edges, lines, and patterns at specific orientations
and frequencies.

üß© Use Cases:
- Texture classification (e.g., fabric, fingerprint recognition)
- Edge and line detection
- Feature extraction for machine learning models
- Biological image analysis

------------------------------------------------------
6Ô∏è‚É£  GAUSSIAN BLUR (gaussian_blur.py)
------------------------------------------------------
The Gaussian blur applies a weighted average of pixel values to soften an image.
It‚Äôs one of the most common smoothing techniques used in image processing.

üåÑ Use Cases:
- Noise reduction
- Background defocus (bokeh simulation)
- Preprocessing for edge detection
- Artistic soft-focus effects

------------------------------------------------------
7Ô∏è‚É£  HOUGH TRANSFORM (hough.py)
------------------------------------------------------
The Hough Transform detects geometric shapes, especially lines and circles, within images.
It is commonly used in computer vision applications that involve detecting structured patterns.

üìê Use Cases:
- Line detection (e.g., roads, edges of buildings)
- Circle detection (e.g., coins, wheels)
- Object recognition
- Lane detection in self-driving systems

------------------------------------------------------
8Ô∏è‚É£  LOCAL BINARY PATTERN (lbp.py)
------------------------------------------------------
Local Binary Patterns (LBP) capture local texture information by comparing pixel
intensities within a neighborhood. The result is a texture descriptor that‚Äôs robust
against lighting variations.

üß† Use Cases:
- Texture and surface analysis
- Facial recognition
- Image classification and pattern recognition
- Surface defect detection in industrial images

------------------------------------------------------
9Ô∏è‚É£  MOSAIC TILE FILTER (mosaic_tile_filter.py)
------------------------------------------------------
The mosaic tile filter divides an image into square or hexagonal tiles and replaces
each with an averaged color. The result resembles a digital mosaic or pixelated artwork.

üé® Use Cases:
- Pixelation effects for privacy or style
- Abstract art generation
- Background simplification
- Visual data anonymization

------------------------------------------------------
üîü  PENCIL ART FILTER (pencil_art.py)
------------------------------------------------------
The pencil art filter simulates hand-drawn sketch effects, converting photos into
pencil-style grayscale drawings with line-based shading.

‚úèÔ∏è Use Cases:
- Artistic photo stylization
- Portrait sketch effects
- Outline generation for illustration
- Comic or animation preprocessing

------------------------------------------------------
1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£  RETRO FILTER (retro_filter.py)
------------------------------------------------------
The retro filter adds vintage-style color tones, fades, and grain effects to give
images an aged look reminiscent of old film photography.

üì∏ Use Cases:
- Vintage or nostalgic image styling
- Film or photo filter simulation
- Thematic social media filters
- Artistic storytelling aesthetics

------------------------------------------------------
1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£  WATERCOLOR FILTER (watercolor_filter.py)
------------------------------------------------------
The watercolor filter produces a soft, painterly appearance by smoothing color
transitions and enhancing edges to resemble watercolor paintings.

üé® Use Cases:
- Artistic image stylization
- Poster and print design
- Scene abstraction
- Background generation for visual media
